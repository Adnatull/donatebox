# Donatebox

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

# Instructions
  
  * You need to manually create a user in admins table because there is no option to register as admin.
  * To check current donation request you need to login as admin and to do that the url is [`localhost:4000/admin`](http://localhost:4000/admin)
